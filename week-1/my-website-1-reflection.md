# Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
Once you've set up an account, go to the repositories tab and click on "new". 
Name and create your repository. From here, you can eithr click on the button that looks like a computer monitor with an arrow pointing down, or copy the link stored in the clone box. In your command prompt, type "git clone" and then paste the url from the clone box.

# Describe what open source means.
Open source means that the code of a program is available to be seen, copied, used, and or sold, depending on the licensing.

# What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
It is definitely a mixed feeling. On one hand, it is awesome to be able to see how something works, and open source paves the way for collaboration. On the other, companies pay their tech departments a ton of money for their services, and allowing those services to be used by competitiors can lessen the value of those services for that particular company. I think that there is a time and place for both.

# Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licensing your work is extremely important. As a creator, it protects you and makes sure that your work will be protected in the manner that you wish. As a collaborator / user, the licensing protects you from any infringemnt or similar issue.

# What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I forgot to create a branch before going throuh the merging process and spent a good amount of time trying to figure out why it wasn't updating. I ended up losing my work, and had to retype my answers. I went through and deleted everything, starting from scratch, and had a much better time of it. 

# Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Unfortunatly I didn't save any, but I did some googling and read a lot about git. I steered clear of anything too advanced, but absorbed a lot of information.
