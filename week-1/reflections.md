# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

     I have actually explored time management and habit forming ideas before and am familiar with many of the ideas presented by the material here. From these sections I have learned about how to build and implement habits by starting small, as well as managing time and productivity through the use of small breaks. 

   Keeping my resolutions with boring or monotonous tasks has always been a personal struggle for me. I will try to implement time boxing or something similar to the Pomodoro Technique into my current work. I have tried before at 25 minute increments, and I think I will cut that to 15on/5off and see how that works.

   Time boxing is the idea of assigning a portion of time to work on a task rather than setting about to finish a project. You can use time boxing in Phase 0 by setting a predetermined amount of time each day to work on the course, and adjusting according to progress.

   The idea of flow is fascinating to me. I think that I am very prone to finding my flow, but I would like to learn more about how to attain it on command, maintain it, and apply it to other aspects of my life. 

   I currently have a "grind it out" mentality. I set to work on a task and don't usually stop until it is done, or I run out of time. I think this strategy is very productive when I get into the "flow" of it, but I can also fall into a rut when I hit a road block. I think that this strategy does work for me over all, but that I need to work on being more mindful of where I am mentally, and force myself to take breaks when I get stuck. I will apply this to Phase 0 and re-approach it weekly to see if I need to adopt other methods.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

What is a shell? What is "bash?"

A shell is the interface that you use to access a computer's operating system. Bash is the shell of a Unix system. To complete this project, I used PowerShell which is a shell for Windows.


What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

I had trouble keeping my focus on the video. I often had to catch myself, rewind, and watch it again.


Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

Yes


In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

I found myself using ls a lot to figure out where I could go, and where I was. The most important command for me going forward will probably be help. I'm good at memorizing basic commands, but sometimes I lose the syntax, which help will solve for me.

Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

pwd : Print working directory - shows me where I am now.
ls : List directory - shows me what files and directories are in my current directory.
mv : Move a file or directory,
cd : Change Directory - move down a directory.
../ : argument of cd, moves up a directory, or multiple.
touch aka New-Item : creates a blank document.
mkdir : Creates a directory
less : Go back a page?
rmdir: Remove a directory
help: Get syntax or argument help for commands.

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?

1. On GitHub, find the repository that you wish to copy.

2. On the top right, select fork.

3. Copy the clone url on the right sidebar.

4. In your command line, navigate to where you wish to store the file.

5. Type "git clone", and paste the url.

By forking, you can easily refer to the source code, create pull requests, and credit the original creator(s).

 

What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
When installing git, I had a couple issues, but nothing serious. Just had to restart, uninstall, and reinstall. Other than that, I had no issues. It was my first foray into the command line, so I learned how to check versions.
