## What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a rough sketch of how you will be laying out your website or project.

## What are the benefits of wireframing?
It allows you to tackle general design issues, and gives you a blueprint for what you will be making. A solid blueprint will create a better user experience and allow for smooth coding.

## Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I did not. I created a whole site and then realized that I had done what was specifically said not to do in the directions. In a more general sense, I am not generally a fan of designing how a UI will look or feel. I like messing with something and coming up with a different or better way to do it, but I do not like to layout the first iteration of the user interface.

## Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I revised.

## What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I searched around to find a good wireframe tool to use. I referenced the website that I created which has the same idea.

## Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I actually enjoyed the article. It inspired me to look into Illustrator. In the past, I have used photo shop in the past farily extensively, and I can see creating a wireframe in Illustrator and moving it to PS. Frankly, I found the whole challenge tedious, but I do understand the necessity.
