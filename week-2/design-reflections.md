# What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

The six phases of web design are: information gathering, planning, design, development, testing and delivery, and maintenance.

In information gathering, you determine your purpose, goals, target audience, and content. 

In planning, you put together your plan for how you would like your site to look and flow. This is where you would create your site map.

In design, you focus on determining the look and feel of your site. This is where you would create a couple of prototypes.

In development, you create the website. Generally, you would create the home page followed by a "shell" for what the rest of the website will look like.

In testing and delivery, you test the site to make sure that all the features work. Make sure that it is optimized for different browsers, and add your SEO.

From this point on, you are in the maintainence phase. This involves updating the content, solving bugs, or expanding the site.

# What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site's primary focus will be on sharing my work and providing a place to learn who I am, and how to reach me. My site will feature my journey through Dev Bootcamp, and beyond.

# What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience is actually split. I would like to appeal to both other newbies, as well as potential employers. I believe that writing towards a newer fellow hacker will solver for both.

# What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

Users should be coming to my site regularly to read my blog and see updates on my current projects. I would like employers to be able to quickly see what I have done, and what I am currently working on.

# What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

You should know that they are linked, and that there is a place for design in almost every facet of development. The industry has moved and is expanding on the idea of designing for the user first.

# What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

User experience is simply how the user feels while they are navigating your product. I believe that in most situations, it doesn't matter how great your code is, or what your application does, if it doesn't have a good interface.

# Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

This was fairly straightforward. I did not find anything tedius. However, I am going to try to find a spellcheck function for sublime.
