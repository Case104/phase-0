/*
What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
	You need to know where the HTML and other files are located in relation to each other.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
	We used flat, clear, lineheight, margins, and font size. The positioning wasn't as bad as getting the text to line up correctly.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
	We used font-size, color, font-weight, line-height, font-variant, and others.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
	We did use a couple of classes. These classes allowed us to edit multiple parts of the site with one section of CSS. It was much more efficient this way.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
	I think that our code was much cleaner. Berkshires site is written completely in HTML. It is rigid, and hard to make sweeping changes. It is also completely inefficient.
