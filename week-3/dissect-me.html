		<h3>What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?</h3>
		<p>In this challenge we used the semantic selector tags. In particular, main, aside, article, nav, section, header, footer, and others. We go over these to build understanding of when to use which tags, and to develop the habit of using them.</p>
		<h3>How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?</h3>
		<p>The browser processes the information from the top - down. They are laid out like you would in a newspaper, the semantic elements going where you would logically expect them to go.</p>
		<h3>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?</h3>
		<p>I learned that you can create custom commands called snippets using Sublime. I think this is an excellent tool that I would love to expand on when I figure out what redundancies I will be typing often. Learning shortcuts in Sublime is something I keep meaning to do, but haven't applied yet. I intend to start adding shortcuts to my toolbox now that I am getting more comfortable.</p>
