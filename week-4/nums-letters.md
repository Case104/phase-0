##What does puts do?
	Puts is short for puts string. It prints the output on its own line, but doesn't store or "return" information.

##What is an integer? What is a float?
	An interger is a full number. A float is a number and decimal or just decimal. An interger will always be rounded down.

##What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
	Using a float will show the actual number including decimal. The interger will be rounded down. The reason for this is because in most practical cases, a decimal is not a usable amount.

```
puts 365*24

puts 60*24*365*8+(60*24*364*2)
```

##How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
	I'm not sure how to answer this.... Ruby acts similar to a calculator. It works in floats or intergers in order to deliver you the returned value.

##What is the difference between integers and floats?
	Intergers are whole numbers. When the result of a equation would result in a fraction, it is rounded down. A float includes decimals and will return decimal numbers.

##What is the difference between integer and float division?
	Ditto above, an interger will return the value rounded down, a float will result in a decimal number if necessary.

##What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
	Strings are text in ruby. You may use them to prompt a user, return information, and other uses.

##What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
	Local variables are variables that operate inside of a function. They allow you to work within the constaints that you provide, and are much safer than global variables. You would use them most of the time, as global variables should be limited.

##How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
	This challenge was simple. It was good to get my mind back into the frame of ruby and out of HTML and CSS.
