			<p>Git and GitHub are both tools used to store and share your work, as well as collaborate and work as a team. After learning that JavaScript and Java have nothing in common, I approached Git and Github as seperate entities at first, but quickly learned that they do work together to provide effective data sharing and version control.</p>
    		<p>Git is a tool for version control. Git lives locally on your computer, and stores data like a snapshot. This snapshot is stored as a commit, which is a saved change that is coupled with documentation in the form of an attached comment. Each commit that you make acts as a savepoint that you can return to. Files reside in three states, commited, modified, and staged. When a file is in the modified stage, it means that changes have been made since the last iteration, but that those changes have nnot been saved. In the staged phase, the changes have been added to the queue to be saved, but have not been stored yet. Finally, the committed stage is where the changes are saved, and a comment is added to provide context. <br>For a more compete understanding of the phases of files in Git, check out <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics">this link</a>.</p>
